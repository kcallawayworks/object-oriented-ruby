Create a program that puts your class into groups! Have the program request the user to enter each studentâ€™s name.  Assume the classroom has an even number of students, so there are only groups of two. For example, you can have the program output groups like so:

      Group: Hermione Seamus
      Group: Lucius Cho




puts "What is your name?"


array = []

4.times do
  array << gets.chomp
end

# Create a banking program that asks the user 5 times to enter a first name, last name, and email. This information should be stored as an array of hashes. 
# Each person should automatically be given an account number which is a randomized ten digit number.
# After the user is finished, the program should print out all the users, for example:
# FIRST NAME: Joan
# LAST NAME: Kelson
# EMAIL: jkelson@juno.com
# ACCT #: 2372041038


# first_name = []
# last_name = []
# email = []
# random = []

# index = 0

# 2.times do
#   puts "What is your first name?"
#   first_name << gets.chomp

#   puts "What is your last name?"
#   last_name << gets.chomp

#   puts "What is your email address?"
#   email << gets.chomp
# end

# 2.times do
#   puts "First name: " + first_name[index]
#   puts "Last name: " + last_name[index]
#   puts "Email Address: " + email[index]
#   puts "Account number: " + rand(29858937509..92353974983).to_s
#   index = index + 1
# end

# Freaking 3 hours later NAILED it!!!
# First name: kel
# Last name: cal
# Email Address: kcal
# Account number: 39355458443
# First name: dru
# Last name: cal
# Email Address: dcal
# Account number: 37138147974
