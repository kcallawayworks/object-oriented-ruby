# Bonus: Read more about Rubyâ€™s hash symbol syntax:
# - http://alwayscoding.ca/momentos/2012/06/15/ruby-hash-syntax-hashrocket-vs-json-style/
# - Create a hash in irb where both the keys and values are symbols. Which syntax do you prefer? (edited) 

# I prefer the symbol method


# Everything in Ruby is an object. All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. ... A string is an example of a Ruby object. Each string object has its own identity exposed through methods like object_id, == and class .
